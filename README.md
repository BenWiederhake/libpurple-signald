# purple-signald

A libpurple/Pidgin plugin for [signald](https://git.callpipe.com/finn/signald) (signal, formerly textsecure).

signald is written by Finn Herzfeld.

I never wrote code for use in Pidgin before. EionRobb's [purple-discord](https://github.com/EionRobb/purple-discord) sources were of great help. 

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

### Features

### Missing Features

* Integrating with the buddy list
* Proper group chats (right now you can send and receive group messages, but you cannot tell which one of the group members is answering)
* Anything beyond simple messaging, really
