# purple-signald

A libpurple/Pidgin plugin for [signald](https://git.callpipe.com/finn/signald) (signal, formerly textsecure).

signald is written by Finn Herzfeld.

I never wrote code for use in Pidgin before. EionRobb's [purple-discord](https://github.com/EionRobb/purple-discord) sources were of great help. 

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.
